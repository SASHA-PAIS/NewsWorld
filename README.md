## Overview

NewsWorld is a simple static news website that has many news articles arranged using CSS Grid. We also make use of the flexbox framework wherever necessary in order to align items in a 1-dimensional space. Lots of utility classes are created that can be reused throughout the website. The entire project has been made completely responsive with the help of media queries for screen size below 768px.
